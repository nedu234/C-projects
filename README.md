# C-projects
Craps game: A C++ program that simulates a variation of the casino dice game Craps. The program rolls two dice, determines wins, losses, or points, and prints the results using dedicated functions for rolling, summing, and displaying dice.

DNA Analysis: A C++ program that analyzes hemoglobin DNA sequences to determine if individuals are normal, carriers, or anemic. The program also checks for genetic relationships between individuals based on shared genes.

Duplicatecheck: C++ program that reads a 2D array, flattens it into a 1D array, and checks for duplicate values using basic array operations and nested loops.

Entryoperatoroverloading: C++ program demonstrating class design, constructor overloading, and equality/inequality operator overloading using a simple contact-style Entry class.

Inheritance: C++ program demonstrating inheritance by extending a base Entry class into Entryplus, adding address details and using constructors and member functions to display combined contact information.

Molecular geometry: A C++ program that analyzes hemoglobin DNA sequences to determine if individuals are normal, carriers, or anemic. The program also checks for genetic relationships between individuals based on shared genes.

TONConverter: A C++ program that reads a number of tons from an input file and converts it into pounds, ounces, kilograms, and grams. The program outputs the results and conversion factors to a file.
